# Execution Guide

This repository includes instructions for handling GUI applications post-execution of the script.

## Steps to Execute

1. **Import Libraries/Packages**  
   Ensure all required libraries/packages are imported successfully before running the code.

2. **Execute the Code**  
   Run the provided script to initialize the process.

3. **Post-Execution Actions**  
   - Monitor the GUI applications that open.
   - Close the first three GUI applications manually or via automated commands in the script.
   - Wait for the fourth GUI application to open. The script will handle further processes as needed.
